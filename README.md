This repository houses the codebase for replicating the experiments detailed in Jorge Martinez-Gil's paper on Context-Aware Semantic Similarity Measurement for Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation. Discover more insights and applications through our [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03520) and an accessible [Medium article](https://medium.com/@jorgemarcc/applications-of-context-aware-semantic-similarity-9c62492be392).

## Overview 🌍

Word sense disambiguation (WSD) plays a pivotal role in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves deciphering the intended meaning of a word in a multi-sense context, which is crucial for enhancing the performance of applications like machine translation and information retrieval.

Our repository offers an innovative unsupervised approach to WSD using context-aware semantic similarity:

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare your text data.
2. **Context Extraction**: Identify the context surrounding the ambiguous word.
3. **Semantic Similarity**: Utilize pre-trained sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to evaluate semantic parallels.
4. **Sense Selection**: Choose the sense with the highest similarity score.

Included are the necessary code, pre-trained embeddings, and test data for thorough evaluation.

## Installation 🛠️

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset 📊

The CoarseWSD-20 dataset, a well-known resource for coarse-grained WSD, forms the backbone of our experiments. It encompasses 20 commonly ambiguous words.

## Usage Guide 🚀

Follow these steps to apply our method:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (refer to the installation section).
3. Download and position pre-trained word embeddings in the data directory.
4. Execute the script of your choice and observe the results in your console.
